# Eight ball website
First thing they should see is a black Magic eight ball in the middle of the screen.
There should be a button labeled "shake eight ball"
If the button is pressed, do a little animation of the eightball shaking.
There should be heading at the top labeled "ask the question"
Answer should fade in, and maybe some confetti.
:)

UI (user interface: how it looks)
* add the heading
* add the picture of a magic 8 ball (google HTML images)
* add a button that says shake (google HTML buttons)
* add a place for the answer to go

Logic
* make the button actually change the answer

MVP (minimum viable product): You want to make the simplest working thing first. Instead of part of something big that doesn't work.
